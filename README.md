# Linux Config Files

This repository contains config files that I use for my linux development machine.

* Zsh       - Shell
* Oh My Zsh - Zsh Configuration Framework
* Vim       - Text Editor
* Tmux      - Terminal Multiplexer
* i3        - Window Manager
* i3lock    - Screenlock i3 style

For now I have opted not to includes exports/aliases as these tend to change between machines depending on the purpose of that machine; e.g. Java development.

As I improve my setup the repository will be updated.
