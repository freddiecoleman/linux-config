# Linux Config Files

This repository contains config files that I use for my linux development machine.

* Zsh  - Shell
* Vim  - Text Editor
* Tmux - Terminal Multiplexer
* i3   - Window Manager

For now I have opted not to includes exports/aliases as these tend to change between machines depending on the purpose of that machine; e.g. Java development.

As I improve my setup the repository will be updated.
